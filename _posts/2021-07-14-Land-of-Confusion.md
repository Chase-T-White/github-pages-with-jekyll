I must have dreamed a thousand dreams
Been haunted by a million screams
But I can hear their marching feet
They're moving into the street

Now did you hear the news today
They say the dangers gone away
But I can see the fire's still alight
Burning into the night

There's too many men
Too many people
Causing too many problems
And not much love to 'round
Can't you see this is the land of confusion
